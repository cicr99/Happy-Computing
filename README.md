```

It will allow you to set the working day hours of each simulation and the amount of simulations to run. After that it will print the results of running the simulations with the given data. It calculates the average profit of the workshop, the average of clients that come into the store and the overtime average as well. An example is shown below:
```
Working day hours:8
Number of simulations: 1000
------------ Final results: ------------
Average profit:  6748.1
Average clients:  23.534
Average overtime:  3.3340251225748703
